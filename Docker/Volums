TO check if any volume created

# docker volume ls

---------You cannot create volumns after creation of the container------
---------IT HAS TO BE CREATED AT RUNTIME---------------

To create volume

# docker volume create myvol1

# docker volume create myvol2 --1gb (not correct)

# docker volume inspect myvol1 ( will show the mountpoint, storage path)

*****************************************************
Container + Volume mapping (-v command)

1) NAMED VOLUME 

****conditions = here you should know the volumn name and the container source directory****

  # docker run -it --name containername -v volumename:containerDir imagename
Eg: docker run -it --name conti1 -v myvol1:/tmp centos   ( every OS container will have /tmp dir)
Eg: docker run -it --name conti1 -v myvol1:/tmp -v myvol1:/tmp centos   ( in case of two directories to map for same vol)

now create few file in the tmp dir once contaneraization is completed 
# cd tmp/     touch file file2

# docker volumn inspect myvol1     (to check the path on local host volumn created)

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol1/_data

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol1/_data  (verify if the files created in reflected from contaniner dir)

*******(note: if you create new files in the host machine under volumn path that also will be reflected in container dir,
just like the windows mounting drives or folders)*******

------ one more way of creating mapping or mountpoints across host and the containers --------
  
2) BIND MOUNT

Combination of GIT, PORT MAPPING and VOLUMES 

** pre-defined git repo named ecomm is saved under root/ecomm in the host machine and is being "copied" to the container 
directory for an apache server container. Please note the destination director is very important and changes to every server
that is being deployed to. for more info you can find under hub.docker.com/_/httpd similarly for other servers like tomcat and
nginx scroll down till bottom to check "THE ROOT DIRECTORY" ***

Eg:

#docker run -d --name myweb1 -v /root/ecomm/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ -p 8686:80 https
