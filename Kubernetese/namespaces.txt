******** why namespaces *********

kubectl delete pods --all
or 
kubectl delete all --all 

this kind of commands can delete all the services and pods from all users

therfore we need a partition with in a k8 cluster which will have respective user control on the same cluster.

######## to create namespace profile:

>> kubectl create ns rajm


>> kubectl run pod1 --image nginx -n rajm



to query the pods from respective user

>> kubectl get pods -n rajm



to delete the user defined pods

>> kubectl delete pods --all -n rajm


to add namespaces in deployment or manifest files:


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: rajm                **********    you add the key namespace and the user name
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 
        
        
  >> kubectl describe pod podname -n rajm
  
  >> kubectl gett all pod podname -n rajm 
  
  >> kubectl delete pod --all -n rajm
  
  >> kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment -n rajm
