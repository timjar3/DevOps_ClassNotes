How to write a playbook

- host: webserver

if we want to beacome a different user to execute our task:

 become: true
 become_user: root


To execute multiple tasks in the playbook:

tasks:
- name: 
  module_name: par1=value par2=val

if we want a module to executed again and again for certain item_values

loop

if we want to pass value to parameter using a variable, how do you define a varibale in ansible playbook

 {{varaible_name}}

where do you define the variable

vars:
if we want to pass value to a variable at runtime ie: while executing the playbook

# ansible-playbook playbook_name --extra-vars "value=item"


to create auto directoryies in roles folder

# cd roles/

# sudo ansible-galaxy init role_name (give as desired role dir name)
